# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

url: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

In this folder, I will be playing around with the dataset, exploring the tutorials available and hopefully develop a better understanding of regression techniques, feature selections and different machine learning algorithms.
I will be mainly uploading my work in IPython Notebooks as I am mostly on Jupyter Notebook.

I am to explore different Linear Regression models namely OLS, Ridge, LASSO and Elastic-Net.
I will also be exploring Gradient Boosting Decision Trees namely XGBoost, LightGBM and possibly CatBoost.
I also hope to explore neural network models and maybe support vector regressors.
I apologise if you can't find some of the models up yet. I will be constantly updating them whenever I complete them.
